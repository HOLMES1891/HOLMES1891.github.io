# About Me
I am an undergraduatue student in the Department of Computer Science at the Tongji University. I am taking a gap year to do research all around the world. Now, I am doing my research intern in UIC Big Data and Social Computing Lab, mentored by prof. Philip S. Yu.
My research interests lie in data mining, especially text mining and graph mining.
